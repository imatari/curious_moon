# For our weekly group meetings
Have you been going through the book for a day or two and you've come across some challenges that you would like help on?  
Maybe you were able to figure it out on your own and would like to share how you solved a problem?

Please share what you would like to discuss in our next group meeting! : ) 

**for our next meeting:** our goal is to cover Importing and Normalizing

Whatever you'd like to discuss, please add your name to this page and right under it, what you would like to talk about.

_for example_
- Matari  
How do I run the `build.sql` file against the enceladus database?
